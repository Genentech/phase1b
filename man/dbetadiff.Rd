The Probability Density Function of the difference of two Beta Distributions.

Density, distribution function and quantile function for
the distribution of the difference of two Beta distributions with parameters \code{parX} and \code{parY}.
We denote \code{X} and \code{Y} as two random variables representing the response rate of Control and Treatment
group respectively. The assignment of Control and Treatment is practically interchangeable.
We denote \code{Z} as the difference between two groups such that \code{Z = Y-X}.
}
\note{
\code{X} and \code{Y} can be either Control or Treatment and \code{Z = X-Y}, subject to assumptions.

\examples{
# The following examples use these parameters:
parX <- c(1, 52)
parY <- c(5.5, 20.5)

# The difference between Control and Treatment is denoted as z.
z <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, length = 100)
plot(z, dbetadiff(z, parY = parY, parX = parX),
  type = "l"
)

# dbetadiff ----
# Calculate probability of Go, if difference was at least 15\%.
test <- integrate(
  f = dbetadiff,
  parY = parY,
  parX = parX,
  lower = 0.15,
  upper = 1
)
str(test)

# Calculate probability of Stop, if difference was at most 50\%.
integrate(
  f = dbetadiff,
  parY = parY,

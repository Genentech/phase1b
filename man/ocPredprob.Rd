Calculate operating characteristics for predictive probability method.

It is assumed that the true response rate is \code{truep}. Trials can stop for Futility
or Efficacy. Trials can also stop at Interim or Final for Futility or Efficacy.

There are two variations of decision rule, Decision 1 and Decision 2, to
evaluate decision at Interim or Final, for Futility or Efficacy. Decision 1 is
used when \code{decision1 == TRUE} which is the default setting.

The criteria for Decision 1 for Interim looks are :
\itemize{
\item interim GO =  P(successful trial at final) > phiU
\item interim STOP = P(successful trial at final) < phiL
}

The criteria for Decision 1 for Final looks are:
\itemize{
\item Final GO = P(truep > p0 | data) => tT
\item Final STOP = P(truep > p0 | data ) < tT
}

The criteria for Decision 2 for Interim looks are :
\itemize{
\item Interim GO : P ( success at final) > phiU
\item Interim STOP : P (failure at final ) > phiFu
}

The criteria for Decision 2 for Futility looks are :
\itemize{
\item Final GO = P(truep > p0) > tT
\item Final STOP = P(truep < p1) > tF
}

Resulting operating characteristics include the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{ExpectedN}: expected number of patients in the trials
\item \code{PrStopEarly}: probability to stop the trial early (before reaching the
maximum sample size)
\item \code{PrEarlyEff}: probability of Early Go decision
\item \code{PrEarlyFut}: probability of for Early Stop decision
\item \code{PrEfficacy}: probability of Go decision
\item \code{PrFutility}: probability of Stop decision
\item \code{PrGrayZone}: probability between Go and Stop ,"Evaluate" or Gray decision zone
}
}
\details{
\code{ExpectedN} is an average of the simulated sample sizes.
If \code{wiggle = TRUE}, one can specify \code{dist}, though the algorithm will generate it if \code{dist = NULL}.
If \code{nnF = NULL}, no Futility or decision to Stop will be analysed. Note that \code{nnF = c(0)} is equivalent.
As default, \code{nnF} is set to the identical looks of \code{nnE}, and if \code{wiggle = TRUE}, all looks are the same, e.g.
\code{nnE = nnF} when wiggle and distance is applied.

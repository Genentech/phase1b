  nnrE,

\arguments{
\item{nnr}{(\code{numeric}):\cr union of \code{nnE}and \code{nnF}.}

\item{truep}{(\code{number}):\cr assumed true response rate or true rate (scenario).}

\item{parE}{(\code{numeric}):\cr alpha and beta parameters for the prior on the treatment population.
Default set at alpha = 1, beta = 1, or uniform prior.}

\item{parS}{(\code{numeric} or \code{matrix}):\cr parameters for beta distribution. If it is a matrix, it needs to have 2 columns,
and each row corresponds to each component of a beta-mixture distribution
for the \code{S} group. See details.}

\item{tL}{(\code{number}):\cr posterior probability threshold for being below \code{p0}.}

\item{tU}{(\code{number}):\cr posterior probability threshold for being above \code{p1}.}

\item{deltaE}{(\code{number}):\cr margin by which the response rate in the treatment group should be better
than in the standard of care of \code{group}. Delta for efficacy is used to
calculate \code{P(P_E > P_S + deltaE)} which should
exceed threshold \code{tU} to to stop for efficacy.
Note that this can also be negative, e.g. when non-inferiority is being assessed.}

\item{deltaF}{(\code{number}):\cr margin by which the response rate in the treatment group should be better
than in the standard of care of \code{group}. Delta for futility is used to
calculate  \code{P(P_E > P_S + deltaS)} which should
exceed threshold \code{tL} to stop for futility.
Note that this can also be negative, e.g. when non-inferiority is being assessed.}

\item{relativeDelta}{(\code{flag}):\cr If \code{TRUE}, then a \code{relativeDelta} is used. Represents that a minimum
response rate in magnitude of \code{delta} of the \code{S} non-responding patients
is included as the margin between treatment and control group. See note.}

\description{
A helper function adapted from \code{\link[=h_get_decision]{h_get_decision()}} by
replacing the internal use of \code{\link[=postprob]{postprob()}} with \code{\link[=postprobDist]{postprobDist()}}
to generate the \code{decision} and random looks \code{all_sizes}.

## Rule 1
Decision rule 1:The trial is stopped for efficacy if the predictive probability of a
successful trial is larger than phiU, and stopped for futility if it is below
phiL. A trial is successful if after the maximum number of patients the
posterior probability of the treatment having more than p0 response rate is
above tT. Otherwise the decision is "failure". In this case, there is no gray zone.


final decision :

Pr(truep > p0) > tT which represents a successful trial, otherwise if Pr(truep > p0) < tT is not a successful trial.

interim decision:

Predictive probability of Pr( Pr(truep > p0) > tT = Successful trial S) > phiU at interim, then we have an early Go decision

early/interim decision to Stop:

Pr( Pr(truep > p0) > tT = Successful trial S) < phiL

Otherwise we continue the trial, e.g. no early decision made.

## Rule 2
Decision rule 2:A variation can be requested when skipping the argument phiL and utilizing the arguments
p1, tFu & PhiFu. The trial can be stopped for futility if the predictive
probability of an unsuccessful trial is larger than phiFu. In this case, the
decision is "failure" when the posterior probability of having the treatment
response rate at most p1 is above tFu at the maximum number of patients.

at final decision:

Pr (truep < p1) > tFu (if it's too high then it's a failure, here p1 and tFu exist)

at interim:

Pred prob of this failure

Pred prob (failure) > PhiFu (the confidence for failing high, then we stop)

## Design notes :

* the original code does not cater for interim decisions
The code only caters for success critical for Decision 1 and failure for Decision 2
* for main function, we flags based on either decision 1 or 2 (rule 1 or 2)
* 2 helper functions for each decision
* in each, incorporate interim 
* intergrative test with grandma to compare results
* We compare results and maybe we stick to grandma's

## 1 Helper function for Decision
    * Decision 1 says:
    * GO = P(truep > p0 | data) => tT, by the way P(truep > p0) > tT = qU
    when the prob of good response is high enough, then we have a successful trial
    * STOP = P(truep > p0 | data ) < tT =  Unsuccessful trial if not successful 
    * EVAL = there is no evaluate BUT there are interims.... in this code
    * interim GO =  P(successful trial at final) > phiU, P(interim_qU > tT) > phiU
    * interim STOP = P(successful trial at final) < phiL, P(interim_qU > tT) < phiL
    * interim EVAL = in between

Interim:
GO: P (successful trial) > phiU = 0.5

Should be a Go since the truep is assumed to be 0.6 and the threshold for a good response (p0) is 0.2, and the final threshold is only 0.6.

## Integration test: grandma vs new
Example: To examine operating characteristics of a phase Ib design with 2 interim analyses
(sample size @ 10, 20 using predictive probability) and one final analysis (sample size @ 30);

* design details
*  multiple looks @ 10, 20, 30 patients
*  True response rate of the treatment group = 40%
*  control response rate = 25%

*  denote treatment response rate as RRS
*  trial success is defined as: P(RRS > control) > tT

 * Decision 1 says:
    * GO = P(truep > p0 | data ) > tT, by the way P(truep > p0) > tT = qU
    when the prob of good response is high enough, then we have a successful trial
    * STOP = P(truep > p0  | data) < tT =  Unsuccessful trial if not successful 
    * EVAL = there is no evaluate BUT there are interims.... in this code
    * interim GO =  P(successful trial | interim data ) > phiU, P(qU > tT) > phiU
    * interim STOP = P(successful trial | interim data) > phiL, P(qU > tT) < phiL
    * interim EVAL = in between

therefore in this example:

 GO = P(truep => p0 = 0.4) > tT = 0.6
 STOP =  P(truep > p0 = 0.4) < tT = 0.6
 interim GO =  P(successful trial) > phiU = 0.8, P(interim_qU > tT) > phiU
 interim STOP = P(successful trial) > phiL = 0.3, P(interim_qU > tT) < phiL

 interim EVAL = in between

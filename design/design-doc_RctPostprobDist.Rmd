Calculate operating characteristics for RCT against SOC,
using the posterior probability method with beta priors

We emulate a randomized-controlled trial setting where at any given sample size,
there exists the number of patients enrolled in either standard of care (SOC) or control arm, and
a treatment or experimental arm. The allocation of patients will depend on the
randomization ratio set by the user and is rounded to the next higher integer.
Therefore the sequence of patients is determined from the start, such that the number of
patients in both arms is constant across trial simulations, however the number of patients
within the control and treatment arm is determined by the randomisation ratio.
Interim looks are for sample sizes below that of the final sample size.
Final looks are only performed at the maximum sample size,
At each interim or final look, a futility or efficacy or both can be performed.

The rules for Stop, Go and Gray Zone (where applicable) are the same as in [ocPostprobDist()] where
the only difference is to emulate a randomized-controlled trial setting.

The returned value is a list with the following elements:
 - `oc`: matrix with operating characteristics with the following details:
    - `ExpectedN`: expected number of patients in the trials in both treatment and SOC group
    - `ExpectedNactive` : the mean of the number of patients in treatment arm
    - `ExpectedNcontrol`: the mean of the number of patients in control arm
    - `PrStopEarly`: probability to stop the trial early (before reaching the
                    maximum sample size)
    - `PrEarlyEff`: probability of Early Go decision
    - `PrEarlyFut`: probability of Early Stop decision
    - `PrEfficacy`: probability of Go decision
    - `PrFutility`: probability of Stop decision
    - `PrGrayZone`: probability of Evaluate or "Gray Zone" decision (between Go and Stop)
 - `Decision` : numeric of results with `TRUE` as Go decision, `FALSE` as Stop and `NA` as gray zone.
 - `SampleSize` : numeric of sample sizes from `nnE` or `nnF` or both.
 - `wiggled_nnE` : user input for `nnE` with random distance applied.
 - `wiggled_nnF` : user input for `nnF` with random distance applied.
 - `wiggled_dist` : magnitude of random distance applied in order of input looks.
 - `params` : all user input arguments.

 <!-- The randomization works as follows. According to the randomization ratio and -->
 <!-- the maximum sample size, patients are allocated to the treatment and SOC -->
 <!-- arms. The number of patients in the active treatment arm is rounded to the -->
 <!-- next higher integer. That is, the sequence of patients is determined from -->
 <!-- the start, such that the number of patients in both arms is constant across -->
 <!-- trial simulations. -->

 <!-- The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is stopped for efficacy if the -->
 <!-- posterior probability to be at least deltaE better than the control is -->
 <!-- larger than tU, and stopped for futility if the posterior probability to be -->
 <!-- at least deltaF worse than the control is larger than tL. Otherwise the -->
 <!-- trial is continued, and at the maximum sample size it may happen that no -->
 <!-- decision is made ("gray zone"). -->

 <!-- A variation can be requested when \code{deltaF} is set to \code{NULL}. Then -->
 <!-- the futility decision is made when the probability to be deltaE better than -->
 <!-- the control is lower than 1 - tL.  -->
